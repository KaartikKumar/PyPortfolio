# CLI Calculator

A Command-Line Calculator for Everyday Use

## Overview
This project presents a basic yet robust command-line calculator that performs fundamental arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Key Features
* Intuitive Interface: A clear and concise menu-driven interface guides users through the calculation process.
* Robust Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling ensures seamless handling of invalid inputs, division by zero, and other potential errors.
* Modular Code: Separate functions for each arithmetic operation facilitate easy maintenance and extension.

## Future Roadmap
To further enhance this project, the following features are planned:
* Advanced Mathematical Functions: Incorporating exponentiation, logarithms, and trigonometric operations.
* Graphical User Interface: Implementing a GUI using Tkinter or PyQt for enhanced user experience.
* Complex Number Support: Extending the calculator to handle complex numbers and operations.
